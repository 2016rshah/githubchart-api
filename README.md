#[Github Chart API](http://ghchart.rshah.io)

Make this:

![2016rshah's Github chart](http://ghchart.rshah.io/2016rshah)

with this:

    <img src="http://ghchart.rshah.io/2016rshah" alt="2016rshah's Github chart" />

Of course you can replace `2016rshah` with your own github username.

#Why

Being able to look back through the year and see how productive you've been is a great feeling, and that little green calendar is honestly one of my favorite data visualizations. But there's no reason it should be constrained to only living on the github website, you should be able to put it anywhere you want!

For example, I personally think it would really spiff up a [personal website](http://www.rshah.io/). 

#Contributing

If you see anything that can be improved send in an issue/PR (&#35;Hacktoberfest!).
