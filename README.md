#[Github Chart API](http://ghchart.rshah.io)

Make this:

![2016rshah's Github chart](http://ghchart.rshah.io/2016rshah.svg)

with this:

    <img src="http://ghchart.rshah.io/2016rshah.svg" alt="2016rshah's Github chart" />

Of course you can replace `2016rshah` with your own github username.

#Why

Seeing that green calendar is so satisfying. Being able to look back through the year and see how productive you've been is a great feeling. Honestly my favorite data visualization. But why should it be constrained to only living on the github website? 

Put it anywhere you want! For example, I personally think it would really spiff up your personal website.
